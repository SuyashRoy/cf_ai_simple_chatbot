## 💡 Why This Happened

Cloudflare requires ALL Workers (even free tier) to have a subdomain registered. This is a security and routing requirement. You only do it once per account.

---

## 🔄 Summary of All Fixes Made

1. **Import Error** → Removed `@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler`, used built-in Workers Sites
2. **Durable Objects** → Changed `new_classes` to `new_sqlite_classes` for free tier
3. **Asset Serving** → Implemented proper `__STATIC_CONTENT` handling
4. **Subdomain** → You just need to register (one-time)
