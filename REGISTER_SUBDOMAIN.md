## 🎯 Alternative: Use a Custom Route

If you don't want to use workers.dev, you can deploy to a custom domain by adding to `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
routes = [
  { pattern = "yourcustomdomain.com/*", zone_name = "yourcustomdomain.com" }
]
```

But for testing, workers.dev is the easiest!

## 📋 What Happens After Registration

Once you register:
1. You'll have a subdomain like `your-name.workers.dev`
2. Your chatbot will be at: `https://cf-ai-simple-chatbot.your-name.workers.dev`
3. Deploy will complete successfully
4. You can start chatting with your AI!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I already have a workers.dev subdomain"
If you've used Cloudflare Workers before, you might already have one. Try deploying again:
```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

### "Link doesn't work"
Go to your Cloudflare dashboard manually:
1. Visit: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Click on "Workers & Pages" in the left sidebar
3. Follow the onboarding prompts

### "Still getting the error"
Make sure you're logged in to the correct Cloudflare account:
```bash
npx wrangler whoami
npx wrangler logout
npx wrangler login
```

## ✨ Next: Deploy & Test!

After registering, run:
```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

You'll see output like:
```
Published cf-ai-simple-chatbot (X.XX sec)
  https://cf-ai-simple-chatbot.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev
```

**Open that URL and start chatting!** 🤖

**All the hard work is done. Just one click away from your live AI chatbot!** 🚀
